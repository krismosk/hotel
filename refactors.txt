1. Refactor all tests to remove before/do blocks to increase readability 
2. Remove reservation_id from reservation and all corresponding tests. 
  - I realized that I never needed to use the reservation_id anywhere.
3. Standardize my describe block naming convention
4. De-couple some of my method calls 
5. Move some of the helper methods from Hotel to another class to clean things up
6. Add both helper methods in Reservation class inside of initializer
